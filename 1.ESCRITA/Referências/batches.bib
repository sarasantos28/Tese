abstract = {Passive Bistatic Radar (PBR), or Passive Coherent Location, is gaining interest in the radar community as it provides some advantages with respect to active radar. Although, passive radar does not aim to replace active radar, it provides a good complement to it. The computational effort that is required to implement the required signal processing is one of the drawbacks that affect passive radar. In this paper a computationally affordable algorithm is proposed and its performance tested by using a numerical simulation.},
