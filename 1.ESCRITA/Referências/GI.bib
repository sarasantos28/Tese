abstract = {This paper investigates various factors influencing the processing gain obtained thanks to coherent integration in a Passive Coherent Location (PCL) radar. In theory, a longer integration time should lead to higher integration gain. In practice, however, some limitations exist, which restrict the maximum attainable processing gain. The paper presents theoretical considerations accompanied by numerical results based on simulated data as well as data acquired with an FM-based PCL system. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},
