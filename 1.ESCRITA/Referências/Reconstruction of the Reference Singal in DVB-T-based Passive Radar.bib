abstract = {In the paper the problem of decoding of digital television signal and its reconstruction for the purpose of using it in passive radar is presented. The main focus is the reconstruction of the signal using a general purpose receiver, not dedicated to digital television signal reception. The performance of the proposed method is verified on simulated and real-life signals.},
