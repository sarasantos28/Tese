abstract = {Passive Coherent Location (PCL, or alternatively Passive Radar - PR) offers the ability to detect targets by using illuminators of opportunity. The principles of PCL are quite easy to understand as we can treat it as an active radar once the IO direct signal is acquired. Nevertheless, there are a number of issues that are specific to PCL that are not present in the case of active radar and that must be studied and dealt with when it comes to detecting targets. In these notes, fundamentals of detection for PCL are provided along with a number of signal processing techniques that have been developed to solve specific issues related to passive radar scenarios. This paper is to be considered as companion notes for the NATO Lecture on “PCL detection fundamentals” of the Lecture Series SET-243 on Passive Radar.},
