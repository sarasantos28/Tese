abstract = {This standard is a major revision of IEEE Std 145-1973 which it supersedes. It is the second revision of the standard since it was first issued in 1969. The standard also includes terms reflecting the advances in antenna technology that have transpired since 1973. New terms include microstrip antenna, printed circuit antenna, periscope antenna, active array antenna system, coutoured beam antenna, conformal antenna and null-steering antenna. The terms pertaining to antenna patterns have been expanded in this revision. New terms include axial ratio pattern, beam solid angle, co-polar and cross-polar pattern, difference pattern, directional null, far-field pattern, Fresnel zone, mean side lobe level, near-field pattern, null steering, phase pattern, polarizaton pattern, principal half-power beamwidths, radiation pattern cut, radiation sphere, solid beam efficiency and shoulder lobe.},
