abstract = {Annotation his book is a major extension of a chapter on bistatic radar written by the author for the Radar Handbook, 2nd edition, edited by Merrill Skolnik. It provides a history of bistatic systems that points out to potential designers the applications that have worked and the dead-ends not worth pursuing. The text reviews the basic concepts and definitions, and explains the mathematical development of relationships, such as geometry, Ovals of Cassini, dynamic range, isorange and isodoppler contours, target doppler, and clutter doppler spread.Key Features * All development and analysis are derived from first order principles or referenced to established literature. * All approximations are accompanied by error analyses. All bistatic radar equations are rationalized; i.e., they are shown in the limit to reduce to monostatic radar equations. * Past bistatic radar developments and programs are critiqued. Fundamental advantages and limitations are identified. Potential bistatic radar applications are developed and assessed. * The 329 pages include plentiful figures, tables, equations, six appendices and a bibliography.},
